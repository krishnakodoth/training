# Lesson 01 – JavaScript Basics

## 🎯 Objective

This lesson introduces the foundational concepts of JavaScript for absolute beginners. The goal is to understand how JavaScript works, how to write basic syntax, and how to manipulate data using variables, arrays, functions, conditionals, and loops.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- `var`, `let`, and `const`
- Data types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`
- Declaring and calling functions
- Arrow functions
- Conditionals: `if`, `else`, `switch`
- Loops: `for`, `while`, `forEach`
- Basic console usage (`console.log`)
- Intro to DOM manipulation

## 🛠️ Sample Application – Console-Based To-Do List

### Goal:
Build a very simple to-do list application that runs in the browser console and allows the user to:
- Add a task
- View all tasks
- Delete a task
- (Optional) Mark a task as complete

### Learning Outcome:
This exercise will help reinforce:
- Working with arrays and objects
- Writing functions to handle task logic
- Using loops and conditionals to control program flow
- Collecting user input using `prompt()`
- Displaying results using `console.log()`

---

## ✅ Assignment

1. Implement the following features in JavaScript:
   - `addTask()`
   - `viewTasks()`
   - `deleteTask()`
2. (Optional) Add a `toggleComplete(index)` function to mark tasks as complete/incomplete.
3. Bonus: Convert this console-based app into a basic UI using HTML + DOM methods.

## 🚀 Next Steps

In the next lesson, you will:
- Use DOM methods to render tasks on the screen
- Handle user interactions with buttons and inputs
- Style the app with basic CSS
