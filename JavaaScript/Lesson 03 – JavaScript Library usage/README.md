# Lesson 02 – JavaScript & DOM Manipulation

## 🎯 Objective

This lesson introduces the Document Object Model (DOM) and how JavaScript can be used to interact with and manipulate HTML elements. By the end of this lesson, you will be able to create a fully functional, interactive to-do list using basic DOM APIs.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- What is the DOM?
- Accessing DOM elements:
  - `getElementById`
  - `querySelector`
  - `querySelectorAll`
- Reading and updating element content:
  - `innerText`
  - `innerHTML`
  - `value`
- Changing element styles dynamically
- Event handling:
  - `onclick`
  - `addEventListener`
- Working with form inputs
- Creating and appending elements to the DOM

---

## 🛠️ Sample Application – Simple To-Do App (UI Version)

### Goal:

Transform the console-based to-do list into a basic web interface with the following features:

- A text input field and "Add Task" button
- Tasks displayed in a list (`<ul>`)
- Each task should have a delete button
- Tasks should be added dynamically using JavaScript
- Tasks should be removed from the DOM when the delete button is clicked

---

## ✅ Assignment

1. Build the HTML structure with:
   - Input field
   - Button to add tasks
   - Unordered list to display tasks

2. Use JavaScript to:
   - Read input value
   - Create list items
   - Append list items to the task list
   - Add a delete button to each task
   - Remove the task from the list when the delete button is clicked

3. Bonus:
   - Add a checkmark icon to mark tasks as complete/incomplete
   - Add basic CSS for layout and spacing
